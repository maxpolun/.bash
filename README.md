# .bash
My .bash folder holds all of my bash configuration

if you want to use it, feel free:

```sh
$ cd $HOME
$ git clone git@github.com/maxpolun/.bash
$ echo 'source $HOME/.bash/main.sh' >> ~/.bashrc
```

but it's got some stuff hardcoded, so you'll probably want to fork it.

## variables.sh

`variables.sh` is gitignored, so feel free to add your secrets to that file. You won't accidentally commit them.
